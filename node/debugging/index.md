There is a tool to monitor and check our application in order to optimise it. It is called clinic.js: https://clinicjs.org/

It provides various tools to identify potential problems in our application, like:
- abnormal CPU usage
- wrong memory allocation inside the heap
- latency between operations

It also creates graphs, statistics and recommendations on how to improve the application

Other than that every IDE provides some debugging tooling. At the end of the day you can use console.logs as well but it is the most naive way of debugging an application
